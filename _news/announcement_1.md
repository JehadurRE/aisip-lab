 We are absolutely thrilled to share that our undergrad Thesis titled "Edge-Fog-Cloud based Hierarchical Communication Network for Traffic Management System" has been accepted for publication as a Book Chapter in 6th IVPR and 11th ICIEV conference with a half-scholarship waived as registration fee.
This nearly one year journey wouldn't have been the same without the unwavering support, dedication, and hard work of my fellow teammates Jehadur Rahaman, Yousuf Hossen and Chondromollika Ahmed. Thank you for your contributions and for making this journey truly remarkable.
Most importantly, I want to convey my deepest appreciation to my supervisor ProfDr Shamim Akhter Sir for your invaluable guidance, mentorship, and strong belief in our work. Our success has been driven by your vision, encouragement, wisdom, and insight. We are incredibly grateful that you are our mentor and be a part of AISIP (Dr. Shamim's Lab)  Lab.
It is a collective achievement, and I owe it to the wonderful people I have had the privilege to work with. I am incredibly grateful for that. As we continue on our academic and professional paths, I hope to have many more collaborations , and discoveries, with all of you.
