Reza studies "Mitigating inter-piconet interference in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) networks Based on Principles of Software-Defined Networks". In this research, he tries to find algorithms to reduce intereference between BLE piconets within a range. BLE has a built-in AFH, but it mainly designed to save BLE connections from the intereference threat of other technologies such as WiFi.
